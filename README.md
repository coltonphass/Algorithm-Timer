# Algorithm Timer

A simple C++ console-based program that visually compares the execution time of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. Designed for educational use to observe how sorting algorithms perform under the same conditions.

## Features

    Clean console UI with animation,

    Dynamic array generation with random values,

    Execution time measurement in milliseconds,

    Neat and readable time display for each algorithm,

    Fun little timer animation during sorting.


## How to Run

Using an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, CLion, Code::Blocks):

    Open the AlgorithmTimer.sln or the .cpp file in your IDE of choice.

    Build the project.

    Run the program in Debug or Release mode.

You can also compile it manually using g++ (on Windows):

```
g++ -o AlgTimer main.cpp
AlgTimer.exe

```
